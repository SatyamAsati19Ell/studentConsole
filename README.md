# **Course Enrollment and Tracking System**

This Java console application is designed to facilitate course enrollment and track student progress. It provides a user-friendly interface for students to manage their course enrollments, view available courses, log their study hours, and get a summary of their academic progress. The system is built using Plain Old Java Objects (POJOs) and Collections, making it lightweight and easy to understand.




## **Key Features**

**User Authentication:** Students can log in securely to access their personal course information.

**Enrollment Management:** Easily enroll in and drop courses as needed.

**Course Catalog:** View a comprehensive list of available courses with detailed descriptions.

**Time Tracking:** Log study hours for each enrolled course to keep track of your dedication.

**Progress Summary:** Get an overview of your course completion percentage and academic progress.




## **How It Works**

The application is structured around the concept of Plain Old Java Objects (POJOs) and utilizes Collections to efficiently manage data. Here's how it works:

**User Login:** Students authenticate themselves to access the system.

**Course Enrollment:** Enroll in desired courses from the available catalog.

**Time Tracking:** Log the time spent studying for each enrolled course.

**Progress Calculation:** The system calculates the completion percentage for each course based on the logged study hours.

**Summary:** Students can view a summary of their overall academic progress.


 ## **Why This Project**

This project was created as part of a learning journey to develop Java programming skills and implement essential functionalities for a student course management system. It serves as a practical example of how to build a console-based application in Java.
